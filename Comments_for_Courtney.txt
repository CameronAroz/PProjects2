1. Is there anything that is poorly commented/looks confusing?
Nothing in particular. Courtney has done a pretty good job of leaving comments.
2. Does the code seem readable?
Yep. The code seems well organized to me
3. Is there anything that you think can be written another way?
Not by me anyway. I really like her addition to Bobby's code that writes the solutions to a text file.
4. Does the coderâ€™s use of loops, functions, lists, and dicts make sense? 
Yep. It actually helped me understand how they worked for the assignment.
5. Are there any bugs or potential bugs?
Not when I ran her code.
